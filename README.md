# Azure Cognitive Search: Using AI Search for Data Indexing and Querying
Setting up Search with Azure Cognitive Search
In this detailed guide, you will learn how to set up a search using Azure Cognitive Search, a powerful tool that combines artificial intelligence with traditional search for data indexing and querying. This work will provide a complete step-by-step guide.

Introduction
Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud search service that allows developers to easily add search functionality to their applications without the need to deal with the underlying complexity of search infrastructure. It offers advanced search features such as enhanced relevance with AI, search suggestions, text analysis, and more.

Step by Step

Creating a Search Service

Access the Azure portal at portal.azure.com.
Create a new resource and select "Cognitive Search" or "Azure Cognitive Search".
Choose a unique name for the service and select the most suitable region.
Choose the service plan according to your needs, considering scalability requirements and available resources.
Required Azure Resources

Azure Cognitive Search (Basic plan)
Azure AI Services (Standard S0 plan)
Azure Storage Account (LRS)
Creating an Index

Define the schema of your index, specifying the fields you want to index and search.
Choose suitable data types for each field, such as text, numbers, dates, etc.
Consider applying text analysis techniques such as tokenization and stemming to improve search accuracy.
Step by Step
Creating Azure Resources:

Create an Azure Cognitive Search resource, Azure AI Services, and an Azure storage account.

Uploading Documents:

Download and extract the coffee reviews.

Upload the review files to the Azure storage account.

Indexing Documents:

Use the data import wizard in the Azure portal to create an index and an indexer.

Configure the indexer to extract AI skills such as key phrase extraction, sentiment detection, and OCR.

Querying the Index:

Use the Search Explorer in the Azure portal to test queries against the index.

Write queries to retrieve specific documents or filter by criteria such as location or sentiment.

Results
With the Azure Cognitive Search index configuration, Fourth Coffee will have a powerful tool to explore and understand customer experiences through reviews. Additionally, knowledge storage will enable deeper analysis of data enriched by AI, providing valuable insights to enhance the company's services and products offered.

This lab demonstrates how the combination of Azure Cognitive Search and Azure AI Services can add significant value to companies looking to extract insights from large volumes of unstructured data, such as customer reviews.
